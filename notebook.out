\BOOKMARK [3][-]{subsubsection.1.5.1}{Now suppose the service provider wants to offer a new additional service to its customers: video conferencing. Each conference call requires 3 parallel channels for each connection. Video conferencing calls arrive according to a Poisson process with rate 0.25 calls per hour per km2, and the conference call duration is exponentially distributed with mean 15 minutes. Recall that each cell has 6 channels. Call attempts are blocked when there are not enough lines available. Assume throughout that the cell size is 1 km2.}{subsection.1.5}% 9
